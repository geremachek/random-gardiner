random-gardiner
===============

Here you will find an (in progress) collection of the transliterations of every exercise from Sir Alan Gardiner's "Egyptian Grammar".
The `random-gardiner` script will select a random exercise and print it to stdout. You can optionally filter the exercises by supplying an argument.
Each exercise is prefixed by L + the number of the lesson it is from, so you can quiz yourself on individual lessons if you like.
