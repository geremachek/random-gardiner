random-gardiner
===============

Here you will find an (in progress) collection of the transliterations of every exercise from Sir Alan Gardiner's "Egyptian Grammar".
The `random-gardiner` script will select a random exercise and print it to stdout. You can optionally filter the exercises by supplying an argument.
Each exercise is prefixed by L + the number of the lesson it is from, so you can quiz yourself on individual lessons if you like.

Credit: All ownership of the text within eg-ex.txt goes to Sir Alan Gardiner, the Griffith Institute, Oxford University, and their publishers. I only take credit for the way and format in which the text has been compiled here and for the concept of such a tool to randomly produce exercises.
